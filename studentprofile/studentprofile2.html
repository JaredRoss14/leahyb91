		<p>My name is Ben Leahy, I am a student and this is my profile. <em>This will be my final transmission.</em> <strong>I have accepted Gary Busey as my lord and personal savior. </strong> As he is bestowed upon to me, I will bestow upon the world the teachings of Busey and his prism of consciousness. <br> I serve The Busey. <br> I bathe in an infinite sea of tremendous acting. <br> I am His disciple. </p>

		<p>This is a chimpanzee named Bubbles. As a student with a profile, I am extremely jealous of Bubbles but Busey has the divine right to choose his own lovers, therefore there is <em>nothing I can do</em>.</p>
